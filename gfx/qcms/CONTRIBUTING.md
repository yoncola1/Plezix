qcms is mirrored to https://github.com/PlezixGraphics/qcms but all development
happens via the regular [Plezix contribution process](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/setup/contributing_code.html).

Bug should be filed under the 'Core' product in the 'Graphics: Color Management' component.

If this process is too onerous, github PRs and issues can be used but they will still need to be migrated over
to the Plezix process before landing.
